# Minor Changes Index

This index is the canonical backlog for lightweight minor refinements that do not warrant a full feature wave or defect entry.

## Policy

- One folder per change: `docs/changes/CHG-####-<slug>/`
- Required files per change: `CHANGE.md`, `ACCEPTANCE.md`
- Root execution tracking remains in `TASKS.md` and `PROGRESS.txt`
- If no `CHG-####` is provided, assign the next available ID from this index

## Classification Rule (Impact-based)

A request belongs in:

1. `docs/issues/` when behavior is incorrect, regressed, or a correctness defect.
2. `docs/features/` when behavior/contracts/architecture meaningfully expand or change.
3. `docs/changes/` when it is a minor refinement (copy, label, token tweak, spacing, minor UX polish) with no meaningful model/contract change.

## Status Vocabulary

- `Open`
- `In Progress`
- `Ready for QA`
- `Done`
- `Deferred`
