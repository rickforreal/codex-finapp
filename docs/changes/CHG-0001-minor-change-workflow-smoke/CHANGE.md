- Status: `Done`
- Created: `2026-02-22`
- Updated: `2026-02-22`

## Why

Provide a concrete reference entry so the new `docs/changes` workflow has an immediately usable example.

## Scope

Create a smoke example that demonstrates required structure and closure semantics for the minor-change lane.

## Non-goals

- No app code or runtime behavior changes.
- No API/data-model/architecture changes.

## Surfaces Touched

- `docs/changes/INDEX.md`
- `docs/changes/CHG-0001-minor-change-workflow-smoke/CHANGE.md`
- `docs/changes/CHG-0001-minor-change-workflow-smoke/ACCEPTANCE.md`

## Classification Rationale

This is a minor change because it is process/documentation scaffolding only, with no defect correction and no feature-level capability expansion.

## Canonical Docs Impact

- `AGENTS.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/ENGINEERING.md`
- `docs/features/CONVENTIONS.md`
